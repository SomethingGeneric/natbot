Your objective is to register for a Proton Mail account.
Make sure you're on the registration page, which will have keywords like "sign up", before using any type commands.
The account's password should be "foobar12345"
Do not type "foobar12345" more than twice.
Do not type the username more than once.
Do not repeat the same element ID for type commands.
The desired username is "jnash45", but adding other characters is ok.
After typing the username and password, you should look for a button labelled "Create account".
